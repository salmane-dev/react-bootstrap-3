                        {data.header.website} currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain

                        A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's
                        computer that allows {data.header.website} to identify the individual with his or her
                        corresponding data that resides in {data.header.website} database. You may read more about
                        cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to

                        <br/>
                        <b>(b) Web Beacons</b>.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web
                        page (by using an &lt; <span class="SpellE">img</span> <span class="SpellE">src</span>="x"&gt;
                        programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can
                        also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in
                        the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with
                        previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows
                        {data.header.website} to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are
                        used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and
                        to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, {data.header.website}might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third
                        Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in
                        {data.header.website} database, visits the cosmetic website, {data.header.website} receives notice by means of
                        the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and {data.header.website} would then
                        update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in
                        cosmetics. {data.header.website} may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and
                        services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, {data.header.website} also
                        uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in {data.header.website}database.<br/>
